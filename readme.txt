This is learning clearly about git, github and deploying an app through Heroku.

Apparently only backend frameworks(server-side) like 'node js', express can be
pushed through heroku directly as they are the ones used to "create an app" 
and not frontend frameworks like 'react' as they are used only to create user-interfaces
and client-side pages.

Apps created can be pushed through heroku by using the commamd line,
or by github.
